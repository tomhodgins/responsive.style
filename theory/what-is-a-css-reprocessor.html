<h1>What is a CSS Reprocessor?</h1>
<p>A CSS reprocessor is software that processes (or reprocesses as-needed) CSS code in the web browser after the page has loaded.</p>
<p>CSS reprocessors are used to extend the features and capabilities of CSS by using JavaScript logic to help write styles that CSS alone can’t reach.</p>
<p>There are many ways to reprocess CSS. In general, the parts that must be present for CSS reprocessing to occur:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Selector</strong> to match elements in the browser</li>
<li><strong>CSS Code</strong> to apply to matching elements (may contain JS-powered features)</li>
<li><strong>JavaScript Tests</strong> to determine CSS to render</li>
<li><strong>JavaScript Events</strong> to trigger the recalculation of the CSS code</li>
</ul>
<p>You can express these four parts in a wide variety of syntaxes, some CSS reprocessors are HTML-based and allow you to write JS and CSS in HTML, others are CSS-based and allow you to augment your CSS code with JavaScript-powered features, and you can also write JavaScript-based CSS reprocessors as well and use functions that take in selectors and return rendered CSS code.</p>
<p>In the pages below I’ll try to identify which <strong>Selectors</strong>, <strong>CSS Code</strong>, <strong>JS Tests</strong>, and <strong>JS Events</strong> are required to use each technique, and demonstrate using those parts together in a variety of different syntaxes.</p>
