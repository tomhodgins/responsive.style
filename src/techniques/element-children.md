description: How can you use knowledge of the number of children of an element for styling? JavaScript is aware of the children of every element, learn how to use JavaScript and CSS together to style elements based on the number of children they have.
---

No browsers allow you to apply styles to an element based on the number of child elements if contains. The `:has()` selector would in theory, but since it has been Adopted into the CSS spec zero browsers have offered any support for it.

Thankfully even though CSS has no knowledge of the number of children an element has, both JavaScript and XPath are aware of this and are able to let you use this knowledge for resolving selectors.

## Parts Required

### JS Tests

Counting Children:

```javascript
element.children.length
```

Counting Tags:

```javascript
element.getElementsByTagName('*').length
```

## Syntax Examples

## CSS (valid, but 0% browser support)

```
:has(:nth-of-child(5)) {
  background: lime;
}
```

### EQCSS

```css
@element .min-children and (min-children: 5) {
  $this {
    background: greenyellow;
    border-color: limegreen;
  }
}

@element .max-children and (max-children: 5) {
  $this {
    background: greenyellow;
    border-color: limegreen;
  }
}
```

### Selectory

```css
.min-children[test="this.children.length > 3"] {
  background: lime;
}

.max-children[test="this.children.length < 3"] {
  background: lime;
}
```

### XPathy

```css
/* min-children: 3 */
[xpath="//ul[*[3]]"] {
  background: violet;
}

/* max-children: 3 */
[xpath="//ul[not(*[3])]"] {
  color: lime;
}
```
